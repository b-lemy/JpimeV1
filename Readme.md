> **Note**
>
> In order to support linking by anchor reference from other documents, please try to keep the section ids unique. For example, if "#webapi_validation" is unique across the documentation, then you can refer to it from any other part of the documentation simply with `[link name](#webapi_validation)`.  
> If the section id being referenced is not unique, the document processor will attempt to resolve to the "closest" anchor with that name. *When the linking file belongs to a specific version, the processor will ignore anchors belonging to different versions*.

> **Caution**
>
> Our documentation is compiled into both pages and full documents. For this reason it is not advised to include paths in inter-document references. Please use unique section ids as described above in order for the links to resolve correctly in both document types.
